Abstract: This study examines the role of chatbots in the development of medical
technology, with a focus on the creation of a medical Q&A chatbot developed using
Python. A variety of data training models are compared and analysed, covering
neural networks, random forests, support vector machines (SVM) and multilayer
perceptrons (MLP). The models are trained on a comprehensive dataset of medical
questions and answers. In addition, the study is not only based on this but also
examines Seq2Seq model, transformer-based model, retrieval-based model and
reinforcement learning-based model. Based on the results obtained from this study, it
can be concluded that the development of chatbots can be effective in understanding
the needs of users and providing professional, accurate and detailed responses. This
article synthesises and analyses the validity of these results and delves into the
implications of the results, advocating and highlighting the advantages of using and
promoting healthcare QA chatbots in healthcare environments, as well as the
challenges that may be faced in the future. In terms of future directions, the study
suggests effective ways for further collaboration and integration of bots with
healthcare environments in terms of future applications and promotion prospects for
chatbots.
